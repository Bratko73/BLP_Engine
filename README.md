 *Welcome to the project page*
 ------------------
This project was created in order to pass the discipline of applied programming and subsequently make a game using this engine.

**What are we going to do?**
------------------
Based on the SFML graphics library, create an engine that makes it easier to create games like Mario, Undertale, Deltarune, etc.
